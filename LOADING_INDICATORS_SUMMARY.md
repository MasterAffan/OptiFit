   - Perfect for inline loading states

2. **ShimmerLoading** - Generic shimmer effect wrapper for any widget
   - Smooth skeleton loading effect
   - Consistent design across the app

3. **ShimmerStatCard** - Shimmer effect specifically for stat cards
   - Matches the design of regular stat cards
   - Used in progress and home screens

4. **ShimmerWorkoutCard** - Shimmer effect for workout cards
   - Matches workout card design
   - Used in workout history lists

5. **ShimmerProgressChart** - Shimmer effect for progress charts
   - Matches chart container design
   - Used while loading chart data

6. **LoadingListSkeleton** - Skeleton loading for list items
   - Configurable item count
   - Custom item builder support

7. **FullScreenLoading** - Full-screen loading state
   - Used for major data loading operations
   - Optional progress indicator and message

8. **VideoUploadLoading** - Specialized loading for video uploads
   - Shows upload icon and progress
   - Optional progress percentage
   - Used in AI chat screen

## 2. Screen-Specific Implementations

### Home Screen (`lib/screens/home_screen.dart`)

**Loading States Added:**
- ✅ Loading state while fetching workout stats with descriptive message
- ✅ Error state with retry action
- ✅ Skeleton loading for user profile header
- ✅ Loading indicators with messages:
  - "Loading your fitness data..."
  - "Preparing your dashboard..."

**User Experience Improvements:**
- No blank screens during initial load
- Smooth transitions between loading and loaded states
- Informative error messages with retry options

### Progress Screen (`lib/screens/progress_screen.dart`)

**Loading States Added:**
- ✅ Full-screen loading with message: "Loading your progress data..."
- ✅ Shimmer effects on stat cards (2x2 grid) during refresh
- ✅ Shimmer effect on workout frequency chart during refresh
- ✅ Loading state for AI insights with message: "Generating AI insights..."
- ✅ Error states with descriptive messages
- ✅ AnimatedSwitcher for smooth transitions

**User Experience Improvements:**
- Shimmer effects prevent jarring layout shifts
- Consistent loading design across all sections
- Error handling for failed AI insights
- Smooth animated transitions

### Workout History Screen (`lib/screens/workouts_screen.dart`)

**Loading States Added:**
- ✅ Shimmer skeleton loading for workout cards (3 cards)
- ✅ LoadingListSkeleton with ShimmerWorkoutCard components
- ✅ Refresh indicator with loading states
- ✅ Error messages for failed refreshes

**User Experience Improvements:**
- No blank screens while loading workout history
- Skeleton loaders match actual card design
- Pull-to-refresh with visual feedback

### AI Chat Screen (`lib/screens/ai_chat_screen.dart`)

**Loading States Added:**
- ✅ LoadingOverlay for entire screen during video upload
- ✅ VideoUploadLoading component with custom message
- ✅ Updated upload message: "Uploading and analyzing your video..."
- ✅ Processing message overlay: "Processing video analysis..."

**User Experience Improvements:**
- Clear feedback during video upload and analysis
- User cannot interact with screen during processing
- Informative messages about current operation

## 3. Package Dependencies

### Added to `pubspec.yaml`:
```yaml
shimmer: ^3.0.0
```

This package provides smooth shimmer effects for skeleton loading states.

## 4. Acceptance Criteria Status

✅ **Loading indicators appear during all async operations**
- Home screen: Stats loading, profile loading
- Progress screen: History loading, chart loading, AI insights loading
- Workout history: List loading, refresh loading
- AI chat: Video upload and processing loading

✅ **Consistent design across all screens**
- All screens use the same loading components from `loading_overlay.dart`
- Shimmer effects use consistent colors (AppTheme.divider)
- Loading messages follow the same style

✅ **No blank screens during loading**
- All screens show skeleton loaders or loading indicators
- Full-screen loading for major operations
- Inline loading for smaller operations

✅ **Smooth transitions between loading and loaded states**
- AnimatedSwitcher used in progress screen for smooth transitions
- Shimmer effects provide gradual loading appearance
- FutureBuilder states properly handled (waiting, error, hasData)

## 5. Loading Messages Added

### Informative Messages Throughout:
- "Loading your fitness data..."
- "Preparing your dashboard..."
- "Loading your progress data..."
- "Preparing your progress dashboard..."
- "Generating AI insights..."
- "Uploading and analyzing your video..."
- "Processing video analysis..."
- "Failed to load workout stats" (with retry)
- "Failed to load progress data" (with retry)
- "Failed to load AI insights"

## 6. Key Features

### Error Handling:
- All FutureBuilders check for errors
- Error widgets with retry actions
- Descriptive error messages
- Visual error indicators (red background, error icon)

### State Management:
- Proper ConnectionState checking
- Separate handling for waiting, error, and hasData states
- Loading flags for refresh operations
- Smooth state transitions

### Performance:
- Shimmer effects are lightweight
- Skeleton loaders prevent layout shift
- Async operations don't block UI
- Smooth animations (300ms duration)

## 7. Code Quality

### Best Practices Followed:
- Reusable loading components
- Consistent naming conventions
- Proper widget composition
- Stateless widgets where possible
- Type-safe parameters
- Documentation comments

### Theme Integration:
- All loading components use AppTheme colors
- Consistent spacing and sizing
- Matches app design system
- Responsive layouts

## 8. Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future iterations:
1. Progress percentages for long-running operations
2. Animated loading illustrations
3. Loading state caching to reduce re-fetching
4. Skeleton loaders for more complex layouts
5. Custom shimmer animations per component

## 9. Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing:
1. Test all async operations trigger loading states
2. Verify shimmer effects appear correctly
3. Check error states and retry functionality
4. Test pull-to-refresh on all screens
5. Verify video upload loading overlay
6. Test on slow network connections

### User Acceptance Testing:
1. Confirm no blank screens appear
2. Verify loading messages are helpful
3. Check smooth transitions
4. Validate error handling is user-friendly

## Conclusion

The loading indicators implementation significantly improves the user experience by:
- Providing clear feedback during all async operations
- Preventing jarring blank screens
- Using modern skeleton loading techniques
- Maintaining consistent design throughout the app
- Offering helpful error messages and retry options

All acceptance criteria have been met, and the implementation follows Flutter best practices for loading states and user experience design.
