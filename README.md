## üöÄ Getting Started

Ready to contribute? Follow our comprehensive setup guide to get both frontend and backend running:

- [**Master Setup Guide**](./SETUP.md)

## üìπ WebRTC Signaling Server

The `server.js` file provides a minimal backend signaling and room management implementation for live video workout sessions.

### Usage

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install express socket.io

# Run the server
node server.js
```

The server runs on port 3000 by default (configurable via `PORT` environment variable).

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Warning

**IMPORTANT:** This signaling server includes basic security measures suitable for development and learning purposes. Before deploying to production, you MUST:

1. **Set a strong authentication token**: Change the `AUTH_TOKEN` environment variable from the default value to a secure, randomly-generated token.
   ```bash
   # Example: Generate a random token and set it as environment variable
   export AUTH_TOKEN="your-secure-random-token-here"
   node server.js
   ```

2. **Update CORS origins**: Replace the placeholder production URL in `server.js` with your actual domain:
   ```javascript
   origin: [
     'http://localhost:3000',
     'http://localhost:5000',
     'https://your-actual-production-domain.com'  // Update this!
   ]
   ```

3. **Consider additional security measures for production**:
   - Use HTTPS/WSS (secure WebSocket connections)
   - Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse
   - Add logging and monitoring
   - Consider upgrading to JWT tokens for better security
   - Validate and sanitize all client inputs

**Note:** The current implementation uses a simple fixed token for authentication, which is intentionally kept simple for beginners. This is NOT recommended for production use with sensitive data.

### Socket.io Events

**Client ‚Üí Server:**

- `join-room(roomId)` - Join a specific room
- `offer({target, offer})` - Send WebRTC offer to target peer
- `answer({target, answer})` - Send WebRTC answer to target peer
- `ice-candidate({target, candidate})` - Send ICE candidate to target peer
- `leave-room(roomId)` - Leave a specific room

**Server ‚Üí Client:**

- `user-joined(userId)` - Notifies when a new user joins the room
- `offer({offer, sender})` - Receives WebRTC offer from sender
- `answer({answer, sender})` - Receives WebRTC answer from sender
- `ice-candidate({candidate, sender})` - Receives ICE candidate from sender
- `user-left(userId)` - Notifies when a user leaves the room
